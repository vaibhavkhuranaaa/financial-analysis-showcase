"""
Here's an example of a Python script that performs comprehensive fundamental 
and technical analysis on diverse stocks using pandas and NumPy. 
This script assumes you have a CSV file containing stock data, 
where each row represents a stock and each column represents a specific 
attribute or parameter.
"""

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load stock data from a CSV file
stock_data = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv')

# Perform fundamental analysis
# Calculate metrics such as P/E ratio, EPS, ROE, etc.
stock_data['P/E Ratio'] = stock_data['Price'] / stock_data['Earnings']
stock_data['EPS'] = stock_data['Earnings'] / stock_data['Shares']
stock_data['ROE'] = (stock_data['Earnings'] / stock_data['Equity']) * 100

# Perform technical analysis
# Calculate moving averages, MACD, RSI, etc.
stock_data['MA50'] = stock_data['Price'].rolling(window=50).mean()
stock_data['MA200'] = stock_data['Price'].rolling(window=200).mean()
stock_data['MACD'] = stock_data['Price'].ewm(span=12).mean() - stock_data['Price'].ewm(span=26).mean()
stock_data['RSI'] = 100 - (100 / (1 + (stock_data['Price'].diff(1) > 0).rolling(window=14).mean() / (stock_data['Price'].diff(1) < 0).rolling(window=14).mean()))

# Apply specialized screener parameters for each industry
# Filter stocks based on specific conditions
tech_stocks = stock_data[stock_data['Industry'] == 'Technology']
tech_stocks = tech_stocks[(tech_stocks['P/E Ratio'] < 20) & (tech_stocks['ROE'] > 10)]

finance_stocks = stock_data[stock_data['Industry'] == 'Finance']
finance_stocks = finance_stocks[(finance_stocks['P/E Ratio'] < 15) & (finance_stocks['ROE'] > 12)]

# Print the results
print("Technology Stocks:")
print(tech_stocks)

print("Finance Stocks:")
print(finance_stocks)

"""
It then performs fundamental analysis by calculating metrics like
 P/E ratio, EPS, and ROE. Next, it performs technical analysis by 
calculating moving averages, MACD, and RSI. Finally, it applies specialized 
screener parameters for each industry and filters the stocks based on 
specific conditions.

Note that you would need to customize this script based on your 
specific CSV file structure and the screener parameters you want 
to apply for each industry.
