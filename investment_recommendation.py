"""
the script assumes you have a CSV file containing investment data, 
where each row represents an investment option and each column represents
 relevant attributes like risk, other factors, and return.

The script starts by loading the investment data from the CSV file using
 pd.read_csv(). It then splits the data into features (X) and the target 
 variable (y). In this case, the features are 'Risk' and 'Other_Factors', 
 and the target variable is 'Return'.

Next, it splits the data into training and test sets using train_test_split() 
from scikit-learn. It trains a predictive model (Linear Regression in this case) 
on the training set using fit(). The model is then evaluated on the test set using 
score().

Finally, the script provides recommendations based on the predictive model. 
You can specify the risk level and the value of other factors for which you 
want to get a recommendation. The script uses model.predict() to get the 
predicted return for the specified input. If the predicted return is higher 
than the average return in the dataset, it suggests a 'Buy' recommendation. 
If it's lower, it suggests a 'Sell' recommendation. Otherwise, it suggests to 
'Hold' the investment.

Please note that you would need to replace the column names and adjust the 
script according to your specific dataset and predictive model of choice.
